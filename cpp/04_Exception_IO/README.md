# Exception Handling and Input/Output (I/O)
Welcome to the Exception Handling and Input/Output (I/O) module of our C++ bootcamp! In this module, we will explore two crucial aspects of C++ programming: exception handling and handling input/output operations. These topics are essential for writing robust and interactive C++ programs. Let's take a look at what we'll cover:

**1. Exception Handling:** Exception handling allows you to manage and respond to exceptional situations that may occur during program execution. We'll start with the basics of exception handling, including how to throw and catch exceptions. You'll also learn advanced techniques, such as handling multiple types of exceptions and using exception hierarchies. We'll conclude with best practices to help you write clean and effective exception handling code.

**2. Input/Output (I/O):** Input and output operations are fundamental for interacting with users and reading/writing data from/to external sources. We'll dive into streams, which are the primary mechanism for I/O in C++. You'll learn how to work with input and output streams, perform formatted and unformatted I/O operations, and manipulate stream states. We'll wrap up with best practices for using I/O in your C++ programs.

Throughout this module, we'll provide you with examples and practical exercises to solidify your understanding of exception handling and I/O operations. It's crucial to master these concepts as they enable you to build robust programs that handle errors gracefully and interact with users and external data effectively.

Get ready to enhance your C++ programming skills by mastering exception handling and I/O operations.
