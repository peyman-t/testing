## Library Management System

### Introduction

**Learning objectives** 
The assignment tests whether you can:

1. Understand and apply exception handling techniques in C++ to manage errors and ensure robust program execution.
2. Create custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to the library management system.
3. Learn and implement appropriate file input and output operations for data persistence in C++.
4. Apply stream manipulation techniques for formatting, parsing, and processing text and binary files in C++.
5. Integrate exception handling and file I/O features into the existing Library Management System, maintaining adherence to object-oriented programming principles and SOLID design.

### Scenario

This case is a continuation of the previous module assignment on Library Management System (LMS). Candidates should integrate these new features into the existing Library Management System, ensuring seamless functionality and maintaining the use of object-oriented programming principles, SOLID design, and well-structured, modular code.

### New Features: Exceptions and I/O

1. Exception Handling:
    1. Implement appropriate try-catch blocks to handle exceptions that may arise during program execution, such as invalid user input, file I/O errors, or invalid operations.
    2. Create custom exception classes for specific errors related to the library management system, such as "BookNotFoundException" or "PatronNotFoundException."
    3. Utilize proper techniques for throwing and catching exceptions, ensuring that the program can continue running smoothly after handling the exception.
    4. Handle multiple exceptions where necessary, either by using multiple catch blocks or by catching a common base exception class.
2. File Input and Output:
    1. Implement file I/O operations to store and retrieve data related to books, patrons, and library staff, ensuring that data persists even after the program has been closed.
    2. Open and close files properly, handling any file I/O exceptions that may arise.
    3. Use appropriate techniques for reading and writing text files, such as reading line by line or using delimiter-separated values (e.g., CSV files).
    4. If needed, implement binary file I/O for more efficient storage and retrieval of data.
    5. Utilize stream manipulation techniques, such as formatting and parsing data, to ensure proper storage and retrieval of information.
    6. Incorporate file I/O operations into the system's functionality, such as automatically loading data when the program starts and saving data when the program exits or when data is updated.

Note: Students should integrate these new features into the existing Library Management System, ensuring seamless functionality and maintaining the use of object-oriented programming principles, SOLID design, and well-structured, modular code.
