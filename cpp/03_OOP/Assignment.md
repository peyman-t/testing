## Object-Oriented Library Management System

### Introduction

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Understand the core concepts of object-oriented programming in C++, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates.
2. Implement classes and objects with constructors, destructors, access modifiers, and member functions.
3. Apply inheritance principles to derive classes, establish base and derived class relationships, and utilize virtual functions.
4. Demonstrate the use of polymorphism through function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions.
5. Apply object-oriented design principles, specifically the SOLID principles, to create well-structured programs.
6. Utilize templates to create generic and reusable code, including function templates, class templates, template specialization, and template metaprogramming.

### Scenario
Develop an object-oriented program in C++ that simulates a library management system. The system should handle the following entities: books, patrons, and library staff. Implement the necessary classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and templates to create a functional and efficient system.

Requirements:

1. Create classes for books, patrons, and library staff, including appropriate constructors, destructors, access modifiers, and member functions.
2. Implement inheritance to establish relationships between classes where necessary.
3. Use polymorphism techniques such as function overloading, operator overloading, and virtual functions where appropriate.
4. Apply SOLID principles to the overall design of the system.
5. Implement function and class templates to create generic and reusable code.
