## Introduction to SOLID Principles
The SOLID principles are a set of software design principles that were introduced by Robert C. Martin, also known as "Uncle Bob." These principles are intended to help developers create software that is more maintainable, flexible, and extensible. The SOLID principles can be used to create software that is easier to maintain and modify over time, even as the software grows in complexity.

The SOLID principles are as follows:
* [Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./01_SRP.html)
* [Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](./02_OCP.html)
* [Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./03_LSP.html)
* [Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./04_ISP.html)
* [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./05_DIP.html)

In the following, we will discuss each of these principles in more detail and how they can be applied in C++ programming.
