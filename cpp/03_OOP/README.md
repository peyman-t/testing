# Object-Oriented Programming
Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) module of our C++ bootcamp! In this module, we will dive into the fascinating world of OOP and explore how it can be leveraged in C++ programming. OOP is a powerful paradigm that enables us to design and build software using objects, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The module is structured to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of essential OOP concepts, principles, and techniques in C++. Here's a brief overview of the topics we'll cover:

**1. Encapsulation:** We'll begin by exploring encapsulation, which involves bundling data and related behavior into classes. You'll learn how to define classes and establish relationships between them.

**2. Inheritance:** Next, we'll delve into inheritance, a fundamental aspect of OOP. You'll discover how to create derived classes that inherit properties and behaviors from base classes. We'll also explore various class relationships in the context of inheritance.

**3. Polymorphism:** Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated interchangeably, providing flexibility and extensibility in software design. We'll examine the concepts and mechanisms behind polymorphism in C++.

**4. Object-Oriented Design (OOD):** OOD focuses on designing software systems that adhere to solid principles. We'll cover key principles, such as the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), and Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).

**5. Templates:** Templates provide a powerful mechanism for generic programming in C++. We'll explore function templates, class templates, template specialization, metaprogramming techniques, variadic templates, template type aliases, type traits, and best practices for template usage.
