## Introduction to Lambda Expressions (C++11 onwards)
Lambda expressions, also known as lambda functions, are a convenient way to define anonymous functions in C++. They were introduced in C++11 to improve the readability and locality of code. Lambda expressions are a compact way of expressing a function object, which can be used wherever a function object or a function pointer is required.

Lambda expressions are particularly useful when defining short, simple functions that are used only once in the code. Instead of defining a separate function for a simple operation, a lambda expression can be used to define the function inline, right where it is needed. This can make the code more readable and easier to understand.

### Benefits of Using Lambda Expressions
There are several benefits to using lambda expressions in C++, including:
* Convenience: Lambda expressions allow you to define a function inline, without the need to write a separate function definition.
* Readability: By defining a function inline, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand, especially when the function is only used once.
* Locality: Lambda expressions are defined at the point of use, making it clear where the function is used and reducing the scope of the function to where it is needed.

Now let's move to the syntax and structure of lambda expressions.

### Syntax and Structure of Lambda Expressions
#### Understanding the Lambda Expression Syntax
A lambda expression has the following syntax:
```cpp
[capture clause](parameters) mutable -> return_type { body }
```
The different parts of a lambda expression are:
* Capture clause: This is used to specify which variables from the enclosing scope are captured by the lambda expression. We will discuss the capture clause in more detail later.
* Parameters: These are the parameters that the lambda expression takes. They are the same as the parameters of a regular function.
* Mutable specifier: This is an optional keyword that can be used to specify that the lambda expression can modify its captured variables.
* Return type: This is the return type of the lambda expression. It is optional and can be deduced from the return statement.
* Body: This is the body of the lambda expression, which contains the code that is executed when the lambda expression is called.

#### Capture modes
The capture clause of a lambda expression is used to capture variables from the enclosing scope. There are three ways to capture variables: by value, by reference, and by a default capture mode.

##### By Value
To capture variables by value, you can use the following syntax:
```cpp
[=](parameters) mutable -> return_type { body }
```
This captures all variables from the enclosing scope by value. The values of the captured variables are copied into the lambda expression and can be modified if the lambda expression is declared as mutable.

##### By Reference
To capture variables by reference, you can use the following syntax:
```cpp
[&](parameters) mutable -> return_type { body }
```
This captures all variables from the enclosing scope by reference. The lambda expression can modify the values of the captured variables directly.

##### Default Capture Mode
The default capture mode is used when you want to capture some variables by value and others by reference. To specify the default capture mode, you can use the following syntax:
```cpp
[&value1, value2, ...](parameters) mutable -> return_type { body }
```
This captures value1 by reference and value2 and other variables by value.

### Examples of Lambda Expressions with Various Capture Modes
Let's take a look at some examples of lambda expressions with different capture modes:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x = 10;
  int y = 20;

  auto lambda1 = [=]() {
    std::cout << "x + y = " << x + y << std::endl;
  };

  auto lambda2 = [&]() {
    x++;
    y++;
    std::cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;
  };

  lambda1();
  lambda2();

  std::cout << "x = " << x << ", y = " << y << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define two lambda expressions, `lambda1` and `lambda2`. `lambda1` captures `x` and `y` by value, while `lambda2` captures `x` and `y` by reference. `lambda1` simply prints the sum of `x` and `y`, while `lambda2` increments `x` and `y` and then prints their values. Finally, we call both lambda expressions and print the values of `x` and `y` again.

## Using Lambda Expressions with STL Algorithms
The Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ provides a set of powerful algorithms that operate on containers. These algorithms can be used with lambda expressions to provide flexible and efficient solutions to a wide variety of programming problems.

### Overview of Using Lambda Expressions as Predicates and Comparators
Lambda expressions can be used as predicates and comparators with STL algorithms. A predicate is a function that takes an argument and returns a Boolean value. It is used to test elements of a container for a certain condition. A comparator is a function that takes two arguments and returns a Boolean value. It is used to compare elements of a container to determine their relative ordering.

### Examples of Using Lambda Expressions with Algorithms 
#### Example 1: Using Lambda Expressions with `for_each` algorithm
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int n){
    std::cout << n << " ";
  });

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `for_each` algorithm to iterate over the elements of a vector `v` and print them to the console using a lambda expression. The lambda expression takes an integer argument `n` and prints it to the console.

#### Example 2: Using Lambda Expressions with `find_if` Algorithm
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  auto it = std::find_if(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int n){
    return n > 3;
  });

  if (it != v.end()) {
    std::cout << "First element greater than 3 is: " << *it << std::endl;
  } else {
    std::cout << "No element greater than 3 found!" << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `find_if` algorithm to find the first element in a vector `v` that is greater than 3 using a lambda expression. The lambda expression takes an integer argument `n` and returns a Boolean value indicating whether `n` is greater than 3.

#### Example 3: Using Lambda Expressions with `remove_if` Algorithm
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
  v.erase(std::remove_if(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int n){
    return n % 2 == 0;
  }), v.end());

  for (auto i : v) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `remove_if` algorithm to remove all even numbers from a vector `v` using a lambda expression. The lambda expression takes an integer argument `n` and returns a Boolean value indicating whether `n` is even. The `remove_if` algorithm moves all the elements that satisfy the condition to the end of the vector and returns an iterator to the first such element. We then use the erase method to remove all the elements from the first such element to the end of the vector.

#### Example 4: Using Lambda Expressions with Sort Algorithm
```cpp
#include <iostream
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::vectorstd::string v = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"};
    std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](const std::string& a, const std::string& b){
        return a.length() < b.length();
    });

    for (auto s : v) {
        std::cout << s << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `sort` algorithm to sort a vector `v` of strings in ascending order of length using a lambda expression. The lambda expression takes two arguments of type `const std::string&` and returns a Boolean value indicating whether the first string is less than the second string based on their lengths.

#### Example 5: Using Lambda Expressions with Transform Algorithm
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::vectorstd::string v = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"};
    std::vector<int> lengths(v.size());
    std::transform(v.begin(), v.end(), lengths.begin(), [](const std::string& s){
        return s.length();
    });

    for (auto i : lengths) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `transform` algorithm to create a new vector `lengths` that contains the lengths of the strings in a vector `v` using a lambda expression. The lambda expression takes a string argument `s` and returns the length of the string.

## Lambda Expressions and Function Objects (functors)
### Comparison of lambda expressions and functors
A functor is a class that behaves like a function. Functors are used in C++ to provide a way to encapsulate a set of operations that can be applied to a set of data. A lambda expression is a lightweight alternative to a functor that can be defined inline. Both lambda expressions and functors can be used as function objects in C++, which means that they can be passed to algorithms that expect a function object as an argument.

Lambda expressions are more concise and easier to define than functors, but they have some limitations. For example, lambda expressions cannot have stateful template parameters, which means that they cannot be used as template arguments in certain cases. Functors, on the other hand, can have stateful template parameters.

### When to Use Lambda Expressions and When to Use Functors
Lambda expressions are generally preferred over functors when the function object is only used in one place and does not require any complex state or behavior. Functors are generally preferred over lambda expressions when the function object requires complex state or behavior, or when the function object is used in multiple places.

### Converting Lambda Expressions to Function Objects (`std::function`)
Lambda expressions can be converted to function objects using the `std::function` template class. The `std::function` class provides a type-erased wrapper around a function object that allows it to be stored, copied, and invoked like any other object. Here's an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

int main() {
  auto lambda = [](int x, int y) {
    return x + y;
  };

  std::function<int(int, int)> func = lambda;

  std::cout << "lambda(2, 3) = " << lambda(2, 3) << std::endl;
  std::cout << "func(2, 3) = " << func(2, 3) << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define a lambda expression `lambda` that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. We then create a `std::function` object `func` that takes two integers as arguments and returns an integer, and initialize it with the lambda expression. We can then call the lambda expression and the `std::function` object using the same syntax.
