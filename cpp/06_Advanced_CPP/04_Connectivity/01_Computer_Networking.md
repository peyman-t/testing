## Overview of Computer Networks
In this section, we provide a general understanding of computer networks, which form the foundation of network programming.

* **Definition**: A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, routers, and switches, that can communicate with each other and share resources.

* **Types of Networks**: Networks can be categorized into local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). LANs cover a small geographical area, like an office or a building, while WANs span larger areas, such as multiple cities or countries.

* **Network Topologies**: Networks can have various topologies, including bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid topologies. Each topology determines how devices are connected and communicate with each other.

* **Network Components**: Common components of a network include hosts (computers, servers), network interfaces (network cards), routers, switches, and cables.

### Protocols and Their Roles (TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP)
Protocols play a crucial role in network communication, defining rules and conventions for data transmission between devices. Understanding different protocols is essential for network programming.

* **TCP/IP Protocol Suite**: TCP/IP is the most widely used protocol suite for communication over the internet. It consists of multiple protocols, including IP (Internet Protocol), TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol), and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).

* **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication between devices. It guarantees data delivery, ordering, and error detection using mechanisms like acknowledgments and retransmission.

* **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: UDP is a connectionless protocol that offers lightweight, unreliable communication. It is commonly used for applications that require low-latency communication or where occasional data loss is acceptable.

* **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: HTTP is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML, over the internet. It follows a client-server model, where clients send requests to servers, and servers respond with the requested data.

### Concept of Client-Server Architecture
The client-server architecture is a fundamental model in network programming, where one device (the client) requests services or resources from another device (the server).

* **Client**: The client is the device that initiates communication and makes requests to the server.

* **Server**: The server is the device that listens for incoming requests from clients and provides services or resources in response.

* **Communication Flow**: In the client-server model, the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds to the request with the requested data or performs the requested operation.

* **Examples of Client-Server Applications**: Examples of client-server applications include web servers (clients request web pages), email servers (clients send/receive emails), and game servers (clients interact with the game world).
