## Creating Custom Exception
In C++, you can create your own custom exception classes by inheriting from `std::exception` or other standard exception classes. This allows you to define your own exception types that are tailored to your program's needs.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to create a custom exception class by inheriting from `std::exception`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

using namespace std;

class MyException : public std::exception {
public:
   const char* what() const noexcept override {
      return "My custom exception occurred!";
   }
};

int main() {
   try {
      throw MyException(); // Throws a custom exception of type MyException
   }
   catch (const MyException& e) {
      cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << endl; // Catches the custom exception and handle it
   }
   catch (const std::exception& e) {
      cerr << "Error: " << e.what() << endl; // Catches any other exception and handle it
   }

   return 0;
}
```
In this example, we are defining a custom exception class called `MyException`, which inherits from `std::exception`. The `MyException` class overrides the `what` function to return a custom error message. By overriding this function in `MyException`, we are able to provide a custom error message that is specific to our program. In the example, the `what()` function is overridden to return the message "My custom exception occurred!".

In the `main` function, we are throwing a custom exception of type `MyException`. In the `catch` block, we are catching the `MyException` exception and handling it by printing the error message to the standard error stream. We are also catching any other exception that may occur and handling it in the same way.

In the given code, `noexcept` is a specifier used in the declaration of the `what()` member function in the `MyException` class. 

The `noexcept` specifier indicates that the `what()` function does not throw any exceptions. It assures the caller that invoking this function will not result in any exceptions being thrown. This allows the caller to make certain optimizations or handle the function call differently based on this guarantee.

In the code, the `what()` function is declared as `const noexcept override`, which means it is a const member function that does not throw any exceptions. The `override` keyword indicates that this function is overriding a virtual function from the base class (`std::exception`).

In the `try` block of the `main()` function, an instance of `MyException` is thrown, and it is caught first by the `catch (const MyException& e)` block. Since the `what()` function is declared with `noexcept`, it reinforces the fact that this function will not throw any exceptions, providing a reliable way to handle the custom exception.

## Rethrowing Exceptions and Exception Propagation
You can rethrow an exception that has been caught using the `throw` keyword without an operand. This allows you to propagate the exception to an outer scope or rethrow it after handling it in a catch block. When an exception is thrown from a function, it can be propagated up the call stack to a higher-level function that can handle it. This allows you to handle exceptions at an appropriate level of abstraction in your program. 

Here's an example that demonstrates how to rethrow an exception using the `throw` keyword without an operand, propagate exceptions through function calls, and catch and rethrow exceptions in nested try-catch blocks:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

using namespace std;

void function3() {
   cout << "In function3" << endl;
   throw runtime_error("Exception in function3!"); // Throws a runtime_error exception with the message "Exception in function3!"
}

void function2() {
   cout << "In function2" << endl;
   try {
      function3();
   }
   catch (...) {
      cerr << "Exception caught in function2, rethrowing..." << endl;
      throw; // Rethrows the exception to the calling function
   }
}

void function1() {
   cout << "In function1" << endl;
   try {
      function2();
   }
   catch (const runtime_error& e) {
      cerr << "Exception caught in function1: " << e.what() << endl;
   }
}

int main() {
   try {
      function1();
   }
   catch (const runtime_error& e) {
      cerr << "Exception caught in main: " << e.what() << endl;
   }

   return 0;
}
```
In this example, we are defining three functions called `function1`, `function2`, and `function3`. The `function3` function throws a `std::runtime_error` exception with the message "Exception in function3!". The `function2` function calls `function3` in a try block and catches any exception that occurs. If an exception occurs, it rethrows the exception to the calling function using the `throw` keyword without an operand. The `function1` function calls `function2` in a try block and catches any `std::runtime_error` exceptions that occur. The `main` function calls `function1` in a try block and catches any `std::runtime_error` exceptions that occur.

By rethrowing an exception using the `throw` keyword without an operand, we are able to propagate the exception to an outer scope or rethrow it after handling it in a catch block. By propagating exceptions through function calls, we are able to handle exceptions at an appropriate level of abstraction in our program. And by catching and rethrowing exceptions in nested try-catch blocks, we are able to handle exceptions that occur at different levels of abstraction in our program.

## The `noexcept` Specifier (C++11 onwards)
The `noexcept` specifier is used to indicate that a function does not throw any exceptions. This allows the compiler to optimize the code for performance and generate more efficient code.

When overloading a function, it is important to use the `noexcept` specifier consistently across all overloaded functions to avoid unexpected behavior at runtime.

The move constructor and move assignment operator are typically marked as `noexcept` to indicate that they do not throw exceptions. This allows objects to be moved more efficiently.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the `noexcept` specifier to indicate that a function does not throw exceptions and how to overload a function using the `noexcept` specifier:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>

using namespace std;

void function1() noexcept {
   cout << "In function1" << endl;
}

void function2() {
   cout << "In function2" << endl;
   throw runtime_error("Exception in function2!"); // Throws a runtime_error exception with the message "Exception in function2!"
}

void function3() noexcept(false) {
   cout << "In function3" << endl;
   throw runtime_error("Exception in function3!"); // Throws a runtime_error exception with the message "Exception in function3!"
}

void foo() noexcept;
void foo() noexcept(true) { // This is fine
   cout << "In foo" << endl;
}

void bar() noexcept(false);
void bar() noexcept(false) { // This is also fine
   cout << "In bar" << endl;
}

int main() {
   function1(); // Calls function1, which does not throw exceptions
   try {
      function2(); // Calls function2, which throws a runtime_error exception
   }
   catch (const runtime_error& e) {
      cerr << "Exception caught in main: " << e.what() << endl;
   }
   try {
      function3(); // Calls function3, which throws a runtime_error exception
   }
   catch (const runtime_error& e) {
      cerr << "Exception caught in main: " << e.what() << endl;
   }
   foo(); // Calls foo, which is marked as noexcept(true)
   bar(); // Calls bar, which is marked as noexcept(false)

   return 0;
}
```
In this example, we are defining three functions called `function1`, `function2`, and `function3`. The `function1` function is marked as `noexcept` and does not throw any exceptions. The `function2` function throws a `std::runtime_error` exception with the message "Exception in function2!". The `function3` function is marked as `noexcept(false)` and throws a `std::runtime_error` exception with the message "Exception in function3!".

We are also defining two overloaded functions called `foo` and `bar`. The `foo` function is marked as `noexcept` with a value of `true`, indicating that it does not throw any exceptions. The `bar` function is marked as `noexcept` with a value of `false`, indicating that it may throw exceptions.

In the `main` function, we are calling `function1`, `function2`, and `function3`. Since `function1` and `function2` have different noexcept specifications, the compiler can generate more efficient code for `function1`. When calling `function2` and `function3`, we are using try-catch blocks to catch any `std::runtime_error` exceptions that are thrown.

We are also calling the `foo` and `bar` functions, which have different noexcept specifications. `foo` is marked as `noexcept(true)`, indicating that it does not throw any exceptions, while `bar` is marked as `noexcept(false)`, indicating that it may throw exceptions.

By using the `noexcept` specifier, we can indicate to the compiler which functions do not throw exceptions, allowing the compiler to generate more efficient code. We can also use the `noexcept` specifier consistently across overloaded functions to avoid unexpected behavior at runtime. Finally, we can mark the move constructor and move assignment operator as `noexcept` to allow objects to be moved more efficiently.

## The `std::terminate` Function
`std::terminate` is a function that is called when the exception handling mechanism has been unable to find a suitable catch block for an exception. This function allows you to customize the behavior of your program when exceptional conditions occur.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to customize the behavior of `std::terminate`:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <exception>

using namespace std;

void my_terminate() {
   cerr << "Unhandled exception!" << endl;
   exit(1);
}

int main() {
   set_terminate(my_terminate); // Sets the terminate handler to my_terminate
   throw runtime_error("Exception!"); // Throws a runtime_error exception with the message "Exception!"

   return 0;
}
```
In the above exmple, the `my_terminate` function is defined. This function serves as a custom handler for unhandled exceptions. In this case, it simply outputs an error message to the standard error stream (`cerr`) and terminates the program by calling `exit(1)`.

In the `main` function, the `set_terminate` function is called to set the terminate handler to the `my_terminate` function. This means that if an exception goes unhandled and reaches the `terminate` function, it will be handled by `my_terminate` instead. The code throws a `runtime_error` exception with the message "Exception!". Since there is no `try` block to catch this exception, it remains unhandled. When the unhandled exception reaches the `terminate` function, it invokes the custom terminate handler, `my_terminate`, which prints the error message "Unhandled exception!" to the standard error stream (`cerr`).

## Stack Unwinding and Resource Management
### Understanding Stack Unwinding During Exception Handling
When an exception is thrown, the C++ runtime system begins searching the call stack for a suitable catch block. This process is called stack unwinding. During stack unwinding, the runtime system calls the destructors of all local objects that were created since the try block was entered.

### Resource Management in the Context of Exception Handling (RAII)
Resource management is an important concern in exception handling. In C++, the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) idiom is commonly used to manage resources in the context of exception handling. The basic idea behind RAII is to tie the lifetime of a resource (such as a dynamically allocated object) to the lifetime of an object with automatic storage duration (such as a local variable).

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of RAII for resource management:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Resource {
public:
   Resource() {
      cout << "Resource acquired" << endl;
   }

   ~Resource() {
      cout << "Resource released" << endl;
   }

   void doSomething() {
      cout << "Resource being used" << endl;
   }
};

void b() {
   Resource r; // Creates a Resource object
   r.doSomething(); // Uses the Resource object
   throw runtime_error("Exception from function b!"); // Throws an exception
}

void a() {
   try {
      b(); // Calls function b
   }
   catch (const runtime_error& e) {
      cerr << "Runtime error caught: " << e.what() << endl;
   }
}

int main() {
   a(); // Calls function a

   return 0;
}
```
The above code defines a class `Resource` that represents a resource. It has a constructor to acquire the resource, a destructor to release the resource, and a member function `doSomething()` to use the resource. Function `b()` is defined, which creates a `Resource` object, uses it, and then throws a `runtime_error` exception. Function `a()` is defined, which calls `b()`. 

In the `main` function, `a()` is called. When `a()` calls `b()`, an exception is thrown. Since the exception is caught in the `catch` block within function `a()`, the stack unwinding process starts. This means that any objects created in `b()` are properly destroyed. In this case, the `Resource` object `r` is destructed, and its destructor is called, releasing the acquired resource. The `catch` block in function `a()` displays an error message indicating that a runtime error has been caught. The program continues execution normally after the exception is handled.
