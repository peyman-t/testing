## Expressions in C++
Expressions are a fundamental concept in programming languages, including C++. An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that, when evaluated, produces a single value. In this text, we will discuss different types of expressions in C++ and provide examples to demonstrate their usage.

### Constant Expressions
Constant expressions are the simplest form of expressions, consisting of constant values or literals. These values remain unchanged throughout the program execution. Examples of constant expressions include integer literals, floating-point literals, and character literals.

```cpp
42          // Integer literal
3.14        // Floating-point literal
'a'         // Character literal
"Hello, C++" // String literal
```
### Conditional Expressions
Conditional expressions, including the ternary operator (`?`), are used to make decisions based on a boolean condition. The syntax for a conditional expression is:

```cpp
condition ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false
```

```cpp
int x = 10;
int y = 20;
int max = (x > y) ? x : y; // max will be assigned the value 20
```

In this example, we use the conditional expression to determine the maximum value between integer variables `x` and `y`.

### Compound Expressions
Compound expressions combine multiple expressions using various operators, following the rules of operator precedence.

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b = 2;
int c = 3;

int result = a * (b + c) / 2; // Compound expression
```

In this example, we use a compound expression to compute the result of an arithmetic operation involving integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Parenthesis
In C++ expressions, the order of evaluation and operator precedence play a crucial role in determining the outcome of a computation. Parentheses are used to explicitly specify the desired order of evaluation, whereas the language defines a set of rules for operator precedence to dictate the default order of evaluation when parentheses are not used.

Parentheses `()` can be used to change the order of evaluation in an expression. When parentheses are used, the expression inside the parentheses is evaluated first. By using parentheses, you can ensure that certain operations are performed before others, regardless of the default precedence rules.

Here's an example to demonstrate the usage of parentheses:

```cpp
int a = 4;
int b = 2;
int c = 3;

int result1 = a + b * c;      // Result: 10 (2 * 3 is evaluated first, then 4 is added)
int result2 = (a + b) * c;    // Result: 18 (4 + 2 is evaluated first, then the result is multiplied by 3)
```

In the first expression, the multiplication has higher precedence than addition, so `b * c` is evaluated before `a +`. In the second expression, we use parentheses to change the order of evaluation, forcing the addition `a + b` to be performed before the multiplication by `c`.
