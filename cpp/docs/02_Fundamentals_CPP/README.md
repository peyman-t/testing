# Fundamentals of C++
Welcome to the Fundamentals of C++ module in our bootcamp! This module serves as the foundation for understanding the essential concepts and constructs of the C++ programming language. We'll cover a range of topics to ensure you grasp the fundamentals before diving into more advanced C++ development. Let's explore the key topics we'll be covering:

**1. Basics:** We'll start by introducing you to the basics of C++ programming. You'll learn about program structure, data types, variables, namespaces, operators, type casting, expressions, and different numeral systems used in C++.

**2. Control Structures:** In this section, we'll explore control structures, which allow you to control the flow of your program. You'll learn about conditional statements and loops, enabling you to make decisions and repeat code based on specific conditions.

**3. Arrays and Pointers:** Arrays and pointers are fundamental concepts in C++. We'll cover arrays, which allow you to store and manipulate collections of elements, and pointers, which provide powerful capabilities for memory management and accessing data indirectly. Additionally, we'll discuss practical examples to solidify your understanding.

**4. Functions:** Functions are essential for modular and reusable code. We'll dive into the syntax of defining and using functions in C++. You'll learn about function scope, how to pass arguments, return values, and explore best practices for writing effective and efficient functions.

**5. Structures and Unions:** Structures and unions enable you to define custom data types with multiple members. We'll cover the syntax for defining and using structs, explore how structs and functions can work together, and introduce unions, which allow you to store different types of data in the same memory space.

Throughout this module, we'll provide you with clear explanations and examples to solidify your understanding of each topic. It's crucial to grasp these fundamental concepts, as they form the building blocks for more advanced C++ programming.
