# Concurrency
Welcome to the "Concurrency" module in C++. As we delve into the world of concurrent programming, you'll discover the power and intricacies of threads, which are fundamental units of execution that run in parallel. This module will guide you through the creation of threads, ensuring their smooth synchronization, and exploring advanced concepts like futures, promises, and atomic operations. By understanding thread-local storage, you'll gain insights into how data can be isolated for individual threads. Lastly, we'll share best practices to ensure that your multithreaded applications are both efficient and safe. Whether you're looking to boost the performance of your applications, maintain responsiveness, or simply understand the core differences between processes and threads, this module has got you covered. Dive in and unlock the potential of multithreading in C++.
