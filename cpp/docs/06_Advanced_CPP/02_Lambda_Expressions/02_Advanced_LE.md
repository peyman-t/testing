## Advanced Lambda Expressions (C++14 onwards)
### Generic Lambdas and `auto` Parameters
In C++14 and later versions, lambda expressions can have generic parameters and use the auto keyword to specify their types. This allows lambda expressions to be more flexible and easier to use in generic programming. Here's an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

template <typename T>
void print(T value) {
  std::cout << value << std::endl;
}

int main() {
  auto lambda = [](auto x) {
    print(x);
  };

  lambda(42);
  lambda("hello");

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define a lambda expression `lambda` that takes a single parameter `x` of any type and calls the `print` function with `x`. We can call the lambda expression with an integer and a string, and the `print` function will be called with the appropriate type.

### Capturing by move with init-capture
In C++11 and later versions, lambda expressions can capture variables by move using the init-capture syntax. This allows the lambda expression to take ownership of the captured variable and move it into the lambda expression's closure (closures will be discussed further down). Here's an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  auto lambda = [v = std::move(v)]() mutable {
    v.push_back(6);
    for (auto i : v) {
      std::cout << i << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
  };

  lambda();

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define a lambda expression `lambda` that captures a vector `v` by move using the init-capture syntax. The lambda expression is marked as `mutable` so that we can modify the captured vector. We then call the lambda expression and modify the vector by adding a new element to it and printing its contents to the console.

### Using Lambda Expressions with `decltype` and Trailing Return Types
In C++11 and later versions, lambda expressions can use the `decltype` keyword and trailing return types to specify the return type of the lambda expression. This allows lambda expressions to have complex return types that depend on their arguments or the captured variables. Here's an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  auto lambda = [v]() mutable -> decltype(v) {
    v.push_back(6);
    return v;
  };;

  auto v2 = lambda();
  for (auto i : v2) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define a lambda expression `lambda` that captures a vector `v` by copy and returns it by reference using the `decltype` keyword and a trailing return type. We then call the lambda expression and store the returned vector in a new variable `v2`. Finally, we print the contents of `v2` to the console.

## Nested Lambda Expressions and Closures
### Understanding Closures and their Role in Lambda Expressions
A closure is a function object that has access to variables in its enclosing scope, even after the scope has exited. In C++, closures are created by lambda expressions. When a lambda expression captures variables from its enclosing scope, it creates a closure that can access those variables.

### Nesting Lambda Expressions and Capturing Outer Variables
In C++, lambda expressions can be nested inside other lambda expressions. This allows you to create more complex closures that depend on multiple levels of scope. When a lambda expression captures a variable from its outer scope, it creates a closure that can access that variable even if the outer lambda expression has exited. Here's an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  int x = 42;

  auto lambda1 = [x]() {
    auto lambda2 = [x]() {
      std::cout << "x = " << x << std::endl;
    };
    lambda2();
  };

  lambda1();

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we define two lambda expressions `lambda1` and `lambda2` that capture a variable `x` from their outer scope. The outer lambda expression `lambda1` creates the inner lambda expression `lambda2` and calls it. The inner lambda expression `lambda2` prints the value of `x` to the console. Since `x` is captured by copy, it retains its value even after `lambda1` has exited.

### Lifetime and Scope Considerations for Closures
When a lambda expression captures a variable by copy, it creates a copy of the variable that is stored in the closure. This means that the lifetime of the captured variable is extended to the lifetime of the closure. However, if a lambda expression captures a variable by reference, the lifetime of the captured variable must be longer than the lifetime of the closure to avoid accessing a destroyed object. This can be a source of bugs if not handled properly.

Let's illustrate this with an example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <functional>

std::function<int()> createLambda() {
    int localVariable = 5;

    // Capturing by copy
    auto lambdaByCopy = [localVariable]() {
        return localVariable;
    };

    // Uncommenting the following lines will cause a runtime error
    // Capturing by reference
    // auto lambdaByReference = [&localVariable]() {
    //     return localVariable;
    // };

    return lambdaByCopy;  // Returning the lambda
}

int main() {
    auto lambda = createLambda();

    // This will work fine because the lambda captured the variable by copy
    std::cout << "Lambda by copy result: " << lambda() << std::endl;

    // Uncommenting the following lines will cause a runtime error
    // The localVariable in createLambda() is destroyed after the function returns
    // Accessing it through a lambda that captured it by reference is undefined behavior
    // std::cout << "Lambda by reference result: " << lambda() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
In the example:

1. The `createLambda` function defines a local variable `localVariable`.
2. A lambda `lambdaByCopy` captures `localVariable` by copy.
3. (Commented out) A lambda `lambdaByReference` captures `localVariable` by reference. If this lambda is returned and invoked in `main`, it will lead to undefined behavior since `localVariable` would have been destroyed after `createLambda` returns.
4. The lambda that captured by copy is returned and can be safely invoked in `main` because it has its own copy of `localVariable`.


## Lambda Expressions and Parallel Programming (C++17 onwards)
In C++17 and later versions, lambda expressions can be used with parallel algorithms to perform parallel computations on sequences. Parallel algorithms are a set of algorithms that can execute operations on multiple elements of a sequence concurrently, improving the performance of the program.

### Overview of Parallel Execution Policies (`std::execution::seq`, `std::execution::par`, and `std::execution::par_unseq`)
In C++17 and later versions, parallel algorithms are executed with a parallel execution policy. The `std::execution::seq` policy executes algorithms sequentially, while the `std::execution::par` policy executes algorithms in parallel. The `std::execution::par_unseq` policy executes algorithms in parallel and allows out-of-order execution of operations. Here's an example of using `std::execution::par` to sort a vector in parallel:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <execution>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {5, 3, 4, 2, 1};

  std::sort(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end());

  for (auto i : v) {
    std::cout << i << " ";
  }
  std::cout << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `std::sort` algorithm with the `std::execution::par` policy to sort a vector `v` in parallel. The `std::execution::par` policy specifies that the algorithm should be executed in parallel. We then print the sorted vector to the console.

### Examples of Using Lambda Expressions in Parallel Programming

Certainly!

### Examples of Using Lambda Expressions in Parallel Programming
Parallel programming is a technique in which multiple tasks or computations are executed concurrently, often taking advantage of multi-core processors or distributed computing environments. Instead of running a single thread that executes tasks sequentially, parallel programming divides a problem into smaller sub-problems that can be solved simultaneously. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially for computationally intensive tasks or when processing large datasets.

Lambda expressions, being concise and self-contained, are particularly well-suited for parallel programming. They can be easily passed as arguments to parallel algorithms, allowing developers to specify the computations that should be performed in parallel without the need for separate function definitions.

In the context of C++ and the Standard Template Library (STL), there are parallel versions of many standard algorithms. One such algorithm is `std::for_each`, which can be used to apply a function (or lambda) to each element in a range. Here's an example of using a lambda expression with the `std::for_each` algorithm to compute the sum of squares of a vector in parallel:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <execution>

int main() {
  std::vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  int sum = 0;
  std::for_each(std::execution::par, v.begin(), v.end(), [&sum](int x) {
    sum += x * x;
  });

  std::cout << "Sum of squares = " << sum << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```
In this example, we use the `std::for_each` algorithm with the `std::execution::par` policy to compute the sum of squares of a vector `v` in parallel. The lambda expression captures a variable `sum` by reference and computes the sum of squares of each element of the vector. We then print the sum of squares to the console.
