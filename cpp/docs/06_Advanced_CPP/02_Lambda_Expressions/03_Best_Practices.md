## Best Practices and Design Principles with Lambda Expressions
### Guidelines for Using Lambda Expressions Effectively and Efficiently
When using lambda expressions in C++, it's important to follow some guidelines to ensure that they are used effectively and efficiently. Here are some guidelines to consider:
* Use lambda expressions when they improve code readability and maintainability.
* Use capture modes that minimize copying and avoid capturing unnecessary variables.
* Avoid using mutable capture if possible.
* Use generic lambda expressions and `auto` parameters for increased flexibility.
* Use the `constexpr` specifier for lambda expressions that can be evaluated at compile time.

### Common Pitfalls and Performance Considerations when Using Lambda Expressions
When using lambda expressions in C++, there are some common pitfalls to avoid and performance considerations to keep in mind. Here are some things to consider:
* Be aware of the lifetime and scope of captured variables, especially when capturing by reference.
* Avoid capturing large objects by value, as this can be inefficient.
* Be aware of the overhead of creating and destroying lambda expressions.
* Avoid using complicated expressions in lambda expressions, as this can make the code difficult to read and maintain.
* Be aware of the potential for race conditions when using lambda expressions with shared resources in parallel programming. (Race conditions will be explained in details in the next section.)

### Tips for Creating Readable and Maintainable Code with Lambda Expressions
To create readable and maintainable code with lambda expressions in C++, there are some tips to consider. Here are some tips to keep in mind:
* Use descriptive variable names in lambda expressions.
* Use line breaks and indentation to improve the readability of lambda expressions.
* Avoid using complicated expressions in lambda expressions that make the code difficult to understand.
* Use comments to explain the purpose and behavior of lambda expressions.
* Consider defining lambda expressions as named functions when they are used in multiple places.
