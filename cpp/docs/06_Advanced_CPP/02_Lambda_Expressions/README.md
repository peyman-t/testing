# Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions, also known as lambda functions, are a convenient way to define anonymous functions in C++. They were introduced in C++11 to improve the readability and locality of code. Lambda expressions are a compact way of expressing a function object, which can be used wherever a function object or a function pointer is required.

Lambda expressions are particularly useful when defining short, simple functions that are used only once in the code. Instead of defining a separate function for a simple operation, a lambda expression can be used to define the function inline, right where it is needed. This can make the code more readable and easier to understand.

## Benefits of Using Lambda Expressions
There are several benefits to using lambda expressions in C++, including:
* Convenience: Lambda expressions allow you to define a function inline, without the need to write a separate function definition.
* Readability: By defining a function inline, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand, especially when the function is only used once.
* Locality: Lambda expressions are defined at the point of use, making it clear where the function is used and reducing the scope of the function to where it is needed.
