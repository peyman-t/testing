# Getting Started
In the "Getting Started" module, we will lay the groundwork for your C++ adventure. Here's an overview of what you'll explore in this module:

1. **Introduction to Programming:** We'll start by introducing you to the basics of programming. You'll learn about core programming concepts such as source code, machine code, compilers, and more. This section ensures you have a solid understanding of fundamental programming principles before diving into the specifics of C++.

2. **Introduction to C++:** Next, we'll introduce C++ and its versions. You'll explore the syntax, features, and capabilities of the C++ language.

3. **Microsoft Visual Studio:** To enhance your development experience, we'll introduce you to Microsoft Visual Studio, a powerful integrated development environment (IDE) for C++ programming. You'll learn how to set up and navigate Visual Studio, create C++ projects, write and compile code, and leverage essential development tools. This section ensures you're equipped with the necessary skills to work efficiently with Visual Studio. You will see some online C++ compilers that do not need and installation as an alternative way to using Microsoft Visual Studio.

Get ready to unlock the power of C++ and embark on an exciting adventure of learning and exploration.
