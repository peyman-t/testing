## Getting Started - Microsoft Visual Studio Exploration

### Introduction

The goal of this assessment is to evaluate candidates' ability to set up and navigate Microsoft Visual Studio, create simple C++ projects, and gain familiarity with the development environment. This summative assessment aims to ensure students can independently work with the tools and features of Visual Studio to create, compile, and run C++ programs.

**Learning objectives** 
The assignment tests whether you can:

- Demonstrate proficiency in setting up and navigating Microsoft Visual Studio.
- Develop the ability to create and manage simple C++ projects in Visual Studio.
- Gain familiarity with the process of compiling and running C++ programs within the development environment.
- Understand how to utilize built-in debugging tools in Visual Studio to troubleshoot and resolve issues.

### Case/brief/scenario

1. Set up Microsoft Visual Studio:
    
    1. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio.
    2. Familiarize yourself with the interface and various features.
    
2. Create a simple C++ project:
    
    1. Start a new C++ project in Visual Studio.
    2. Configure project settings (if necessary).
    3. Add a source file to the project.
    
3. Write a basic "Hello, World!" program in C++:
    
    1. Include the necessary headers and namespace.
    2. Write a main() function that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
    
4. Compile and run your "Hello, World!" program:
    
    1. Use Visual Studio to compile your program.
    2. Run your program and verify the output in the console window.
    

### Deliverable

A link to a git repository with the project and a [README.md](http://README.md) file containing the following information:

1. Introduction to what your project is.
2. What software you used to create and run this; the target operating system.
3. Your name as the creator/maintainer.
